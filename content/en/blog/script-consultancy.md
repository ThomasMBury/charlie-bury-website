As a script consultant, my role is to analyse your screenplay and provide detailed feedback on its key elements: story, structure, character arcs, dialogue, themes, and market potential. This feedback is designed to elevate your script, making it stand out to financiers, producers, and distributors.

**Analytical Precision:**
My strong analytical skills allow me to break down complex narratives and offer clear, actionable advice to refine and enhance your storytelling.
