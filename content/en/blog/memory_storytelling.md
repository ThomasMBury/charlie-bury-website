## Memory + Imagination + Depth of Feeling"

In contemplating the essence of storytelling, it becomes clear that a powerful narrative is built upon three pillars: memory, imagination, and depth of feeling. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the creation of a story that resonates with audiences on a profound level.

Memory often serves as the foundation of our narratives, providing the raw material from which we craft our tales. Our personal experiences, the moments we’ve lived and the emotions we’ve felt, are the threads that weave the fabric of such stories. Memory allows us to draw upon a reservoir of lived experiences, lending authenticity and relatability to our characters and plots.

Imagination acts as the creative force that transforms these memories (or in depth research into the memories of another) into something greater than their original form. It is through imagination that we can transcend the limitations of reality, exploring new possibilities, worlds, and perspectives. Imagination breathes life into our memories, infusing them with novel twists and extraordinary circumstances that captivate and inspire.

Depth of Feeling is the emotional core that gives our stories their power. Without genuine emotion, a story lacks the ability to move its audience. It is through the depth of feeling that we connect with others, evoking empathy, joy, sorrow, and hope. This emotional resonance is what makes a story memorable and impactful, leaving a lasting impression on those who experience it.

## A Spiritual Reflection

Our consciousness is connected to an artwork via a channel that is not made up of the things of this earth.

This reflection brings us to a deeper understanding of the relationship between our consciousness and the art we create. The connection we feel to a piece of artwork transcends the physical realm; it is an ethereal link, a channel that allows the intangible essence of our inner selves to be expressed through the tangible medium of art.

The I of consciousness, our true self, has no ground in the material world. It is not bound by the limitations of physical existence but instead finds its expression through the perspective of the artwork. When we engage with a piece of art - whether as creators or as appreciators - we tap into this channel, allowing our consciousness to flow through and merge with the art.

This transcendental connection is what gives art its power and significance. It allows us to communicate and share our deepest truths, emotions, and visions in a way that transcends language and logic. Art becomes a vessel through which the essence of our consciousness is conveyed, offering a glimpse into the ungrounded reality of our inner world.
