A script consultant analyses your screenplay, giving comprehensive feedback on the elements of story and screenplay craft that can turn a good script into a great one. 

The level of detail and creative input from the consultant (often termed a script doctor or analyst) can vary from writer to writer, project to project, and, of course, the amount one is willing to pay for a full breakdown of their favourite *child*.     

So how does one warrant being a story expert in the film & TV industries? Here are six vital qualities. 

**A Deep Understanding and Passion for Storytelling**

Not merely a love of going to the movies, but of breaking them down, of obtaining a comprehensive knowledge of, first and foremost, story structure, character arcs, dialogue, theme, and genre conventions. 

Practically, this involves reading thousands of scripts, beating out their narratives, analysing them, and placing them commercially - if they are produced screenplays, then watching the completed film and seeing what differed from script to screen can give insights into the lifeblood of the story; what made the cut. 

The other key to understanding story is to note subgenres and the audience expectations that go with them. Without an insight into genre, your film cannot be marketed.   

**Industry Insight**

Awareness of current market trends and what producers and audiences expect.

**Analytical Mastery**

**Empathy and Patience**

**An Objective Perspective**

**Professionalism and Reliability**



Do writers and companies value your feedback and expertise? 

Nobody in the industry knows for certain what projects will land, but if, as a script consultant, a project you work on and champion does get made and do handsomely, then win win -- credit is due to your well-informed insight and clever gut instinct.
