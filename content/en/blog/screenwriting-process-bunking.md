I recently finished the first draft of a new short film screenplay. It's a contemporary thriller that sprang from a curious seed of inspiration -- an anonymous story from Chinese folklore. It features a peasant's desperate escape from assault and a chilling twist of mistaken identity. 

For me each project starts with an idea that captivates one and lingers in ones thoughts, for a good while -- a few weeks at least. This initial idea often reveals the core theme, or a distinct image, or a gripping plot twist, or an irresistible character that one wants to get to know more deeply.   

### 1. Outlining and Research

- **Starting with a Plot**: For this project, I began with a plot hook around which I could build the narrative -- the case of mistaken identity. 
- **Developing Characters and Setting**: Integral to outlining and research is establishng the setting and developing detailed character profiles.
- **Shaping the Narrative**: Outlining the entire narrative, which is crucial, though flexible to changes as the script develops. A creative process is never bound entirely to the plan that precedes it. 

### 2. Drafting

- **Enjoying the Creative Freedom**: Drafting is where most of the fun is, letting imagination take the reins. 
- **Focus on the Story**: I don’t stress over formatting or stylistic elements at the drafting stage; it’s all about getting the story down, structurally and logically sound.
- **Pen and Paper Approach**: I find there’s a unique joy in physically writing out the story, feeling each word take shape. Then one can smash it out on the keyboard.  

### 3. Polishing and Editing

- **The First Official Draft**: After the initial drafting, I move on to polishing, which essentially becomes the first complete draft.
- **Editing and Typing Up**: This stage involves refining and typing up the script, preparing it for feedback. Often cutting is needed, especially where prose imagery is concerned. 

### 4. Feedback and Revision

- **Waiting for Notes**: Once the screenplay is sent out, I refrain from making further changes until feedback is received.
- **Collating Suggestions**: It’s more efficient to collate all the feedback and make revisions in a single pass.
- **Focusing on New Projects**: The wait can be long, so I divert my energy to new writing projects.

Every screenwriting journey is unique; the process continually evolves. Embracing change and collaboration is necessary in an environment where different voices and visions come into play. Yet one can't deny savouring the quiet moments alone with the imagination, drafting and shaping an ideal vision of cinematic reality.

Ultimately then, the creative journey of a screenwriter is one from a simple idea into a screenplay you hope will captivate the reader and later audiences in the cinema. You are the seed before it has sprouted.
