I recently finished drafting a contemporary thriller that sprang from a curious seed of inspiration: an anonymous story from Chinese folklore. It features a peasant's desperate escape from assault and a chilling twist of mistaken identity. 

Personally, each project starts with an idea that captivates and lingers in my thoughts, for a few weeks at least. This initial idea often reveals the core theme, or a distinct image, or a gripping plot twist, or an irresistible character that one wants to get to know more deeply; something to run with.   

### 1. Outlining and Research

- **Starting with a Plot**: For this project, I began with a plot hook around which I could build the narrative.
- **Developing Characters and Setting**: Integral to outlining and research is establishing the setting and developing detailed character profiles.
- **Shaping the Narrative**: Crucially, outlining the whole thing, though keeping the story flexible to changes as it naturally develops. A creative process is never strictly bound to the plan that precedes it. 

### 2. Drafting

- **Enjoying the Creative Freedom**: Drafting is where most of the fun is, letting your imagination take the reins. 
- **Focus on the Story**: I don’t stress over formatting or stylistic elements at the drafting stage; it’s all about getting the story down, structurally and logically sound.
- **Pen and Paper Approach**: I find there’s a unique joy in physically writing and feeling each word take shape. Then smash the keyboad. 

### 3. Polishing and Editing

- **The First Official Draft**: After the initial drafting, I move on to polishing.
- **Editing and Typing Up**: This stage involves refining and preparing the script for feedback. Usually, a lot of cutting. 

### 4. Feedback and Revision

- **Waiting for Notes**: Once the screenplay is out, I refrain from making further changes until receiving feedback.
- **Collating Suggestions**: It’s more efficient to collate all the feedback and make revisions in a single pass.
- **Focusing on New Projects**: The wait can be long, so I divert my energy to new writing projects.

Every screenwriting journey is unique and continually evolves. Embracing change and collaboration is necessary in an environment where different voices and visions come into play. Yet one won't deny savouring the quiet moments alone with the imagination, drafting and shaping one's ideal version of the film. 

This is a creative journey from a simple idea into a screenplay you hope will captivate the reader and later audiences in the cinema. You are the seed before it has sprouted.
