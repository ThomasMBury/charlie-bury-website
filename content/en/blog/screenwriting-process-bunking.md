I recently completed a contemporary thriller inspired by an anonymous story from Chinese folklore. This tale, featuring a peasant's desperate escape from assault and a chilling twist of mistaken identity, planted the seed for my narrative. Every project starts with an idea that captivates my imagination and lingers for weeks, shaping the core theme, a distinct image, or an irresistible character.

## Outlining and Research

**Initial Hook:** The narrative began with a compelling plot hook, which served as the foundation for the story.
**Character and Setting Development:** Creating detailed character profiles and establishing a vivid setting were crucial steps in this phase.
**Shaping the Narrative:** While outlining the entire plot, I remained open to changes, allowing the story to evolve naturally.


## Drafting

**Unleashing Imagination:** Drafting is where the real fun begins, letting imagination take the lead.
**Story Focus:** At this stage, I concentrate on the storyline, ensuring it is structurally and logically sound, without worrying about formatting or stylistic details.
**Pen and Paper:** Thereâ€™s a unique joy in physically writing the draft before transferring it to the keyboard.


## Polishing and Editing

**First Official Draft:** After completing the initial draft, the focus shifts to polishing.
**Editing Process:** This involves refining the script, making necessary cuts, and preparing it for feedback.


## Feedback and Revision

**Collating Suggestions:** Once feedback is received, I collate all suggestions and make revisions in a single pass.
**New Projects:** During the wait, I channel my energy into new writing projects, ensuring continuous creativity.


## Embracing the Journey

Every screenwriting journey is unique and continually evolves. Embracing change and collaboration is essential in a creative environment where different voices and visions come into play. Yet, there's unparalleled joy in the quiet moments alone with your imagination, crafting a story that you hope will captivate readers and later audiences in the cinema.

From a simple idea to a finished screenplay, the journey is as fulfilling as the destination.
