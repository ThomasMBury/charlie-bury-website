title: "The Creative Journey of Writing 'Bunking' - A Short Film Screenplay"
---

I recently finished the first draft of my new short film screenplay, ['Bunking'](https://www.charliebury.com/screenplays/bunking/). This contemporary thriller sprang from an intriguing seed of inspiration found in an anonymous story from Chinese folklore. The essence of it revolves around an a peasant's desperate escape and a chilling twist of mistaken identity. 

Each project starts with an idea that captivates you and lingers in your thoughts. It's the beginning of the screenwriting process for bringing something to life. I find it often reveals the core theme, and it could be just a distinct image, a gripping plot twist, or an irresistible character, and so on. 

Here's a brief overview of my process on 'Bunking':   

## The Screenwriting Process

### 1. Outlining and Research

- **Starting with a Plot**: In this case, I began with a plot idea, around which I could build a suitable story world.
- **Developing Characters and Setting**: Integral to this phase is researching the setting and developing your character profiles.
- **Shaping the Narrative**: Otherwise known as outlining, which is crucial, though it remains flexible and open to changes as the script develops.

### 2. Drafting

- **Enjoying the Creative Freedom**: Drafting is where the real fun lies, letting imagination take the reins.
- **Focus on the Story**: I don’t stress over formatting or stylistic elements at this stage; it’s all about getting the story structure down.
- **Pen and Paper Approach**: There’s a unique joy in physically writing out the story, feeling each word take shape. That's my approach. 

### 3. Polishing and Editing

- **The First Official Draft**: After the initial drafting, I move on to polishing, which essentially becomes the first complete draft.
- **Editing and Typing Up**: This stage involves refining and typing up the script, preparing it for feedback. For the first reader. 

### 4. Feedback and Revision

- **Waiting for Notes**: Once the screenplay is sent out, I refrain from making further changes until feedback is received.
- **Collating Suggestions**: It’s more efficient to collate all the feedback and make revisions in a single pass.
- **Focusing on New Projects**: The wait can be long, so I divert my energy to new writing projects.

Every screenwriting journey is unique, and the process continually evolves. Embracing change and collaboration is necessary in an environment where different voices and visions come into play. 

However, the most fun for me as a screenwriter is in those solitary moments with the imagination, drafting and shaping one's ideal vision at the beginning stages. So this is the creative process – a journey from a mere idea to a screenplay you hope will captivate your reader and later audiences in the cinema.
