title: "Every NO Brings You Closer to a YES?"
---

I recently thought about how I’m handling rejection, aside from sorrows.

**1) Every NO Technically does Bring You Closer to a YES (if you don't stop at no...)**

By logic, keep on applying and eventually you will get somewhere, a bit closer to a yes, or a thump on the nose... 

But let's forget about speculation. As every no CAN fuel your resilience. It is motivation to do better. It is a chance to reassess your plan of action, to try a new way of breaking in - all with a self-pat on the shoulder for not giving up on your vision.

**2) The Criticism is NOT Personal**

We can’t control how others will perceive our work. And if they think it's a turd, that’s their view. If you also think it's a turd, then don't let that be a reflection of your self-worth. As you are not merely a writer, or an artist, but a humble and decent human being. 

This is called separating work from our identity. But it never has been easy. Virginia, Sylvia, Edgar, Ernest? Just be grateful you aren't a prose specialist...

**3) The Buddhist Approach**

Non-attachment. Liberate your emotions from your work. Be passionate about it, but remember the ultimate cause, the purpose of creating something, is much greater than yourself. 

Striking gold, your story might be perceived by billions of people, in the darkness, so how great is that? Where is the attachment in that? Let your audience do the hard work.

**4) Feedback**

Rejection is a chance to improve CRAFT. Enhance skills. Even if you vehemently disagree with the notes, you can find new inspiration in the absurdity of them, or just maybe, a true reflection, that perhaps emerges after a wild night of subconscious dreams.

Don't ever tire of looking for new ways to tweak your writing beyond expectations. Keep honing your unique voice, which is inseparable from good craft. 

So next time you get stung, refer back to these four fail-safes.
