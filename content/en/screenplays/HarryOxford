Harry Oxford, an autistic man in his early 30s, navigates the pitfalls of modern dating vs. familiar expectations, discovering his true self in the process.  

An offbeat, sweet comedy-drama series set against the backdrop of contemporary London. Harry Oxford, a priviledged Bloomsbury resident, is thrust into modern dating in a bid to satisfy his aunt's demand for marriage and retain occupancy of his apartment. He is matched with Hattie Thoroughgood for a highbrow opera night with Hattie, but it's disastrous, and Harry has to prove his worth by competing in the Thoroughgood's tennis tournament, which leads to an unexpected revelation of Harry's love interests. 

A clash of old-world ideals with contemporary romance, a journey of personal awakening, Harry Oxford slowly begins to discover himself, contemplating the true meaning of love and partnership. A series brimming with wit, irony, and heartfelt moments.
