*On the North Yorkshire Moors, a young tourist's escape from an attempted assault takes a harrowing turn when she seeks refuge in a seemingly safe cottage, only to find herself ensnared in a darker web of deception and must summon all her cunning and courage to survive.* 

I once bunked with a stranger, and so this idea was born - out of my own paranoia. Betrayal, survival, these are themes that a thriller cannot live without...
