From London to Plymvale, rural Devon, ANA (16) expects a dreary life following her mother's dream of becoming a landscape painter. But all that changes when she meets MONICA, openly gay and confident. Chasing her desires, Ana is led down a reckless path and falls deeply for Monica, not yet realising the price of first love. 


Adolescence is messy at the best of times and life-threatening at the worst of times. It is a journey that must be taken in order to 'come-of-age'. Ana plunges into the depths of her psyche to discover the truth of what it means to love and to be loved, and to come upon the necessary maturity - beyond desire. Though country landscapes can be pretty, rural England is far from idyllic. It's dull when you have nowhere to go. Being transgressive becomes an occupation, not a choice. 

The vision for the film is social realist combined with a dream-like quality. Gritty but entertaining. Fast paced and dynanic. An exciting, throwback soundtrack. Comparable in style to recent films such as _Ali & Ava_ (2022, Clio Bernard) and _The Worst Person In The World_ (2022, Joachim Trier).
