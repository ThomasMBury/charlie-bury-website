title: "Late Diagnosis"

When a socially awkward young man in London begins to suspect he is autistic, his search for diagnosis and connection pulls him between a safe but nostalgic friendship and the risky allure of a neighbour he admires, forcing him to confront identity, love, and self-acceptance.
