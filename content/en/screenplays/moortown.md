In the quaint yet mysterious town of _Moortown_, the sudden and enigmatic death of Kyle Mason, a charismatic choirmaster known for his controversial choice of a pagan hymn at the Christmas recital, plunges the community into a whirlwind of speculation and fear. David Stephens, a respected psychologist and the father of Kyle's grieving widow, Leah, finds himself at the heart of the investigation. Struggling to cope with his daughter's turmoil and the town's burgeoning hysteria over alleged curses and forbidden lore, David embarks on a quest for truth that leads him through hidden resentments, forbidden affairs, and dark secrets that some would kill to keep buried.

As David delves deeper he uncovers shocking revelations about the people he thought he knew, including the disturbing motive behind Kyle's murder. The closer he gets to the truth, the more he is forced to confront his own doubts about rationality, the power of ancient beliefs, and the human capacity for vengeance and redemption.
