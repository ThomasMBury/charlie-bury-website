![Sister Eugenia in contemplation](/images/Eugenia_contemplation.jpg)

_A medieval nun is led down the path of forbidden knowledge and must fight for her sanity and her life._

In the serene yet austere confines of a medieval convent, Sister Eugenia's life of prayer and devotion is shattered by eerie whispers and hidden figures that breach the sacred solitude. Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a mysterious demon's seductive promises, she finds herself entangled in a web of temptations, challenging her faith. 

As she navigates this perilous path, her quest for understanding plunges the convent into a spiritual crisis. The community she once cherished turns against her, marking her as a pariah to be shunned and punished. But in her darkest hour, an angelic vision offers a glimmer of hope for redemption.
