Harry Oxford, an autistic man in his early 30s, navigates the pitfalls of modern dating vs. familiar expectations, discovering his true self in the process.  

An offbeat, sweet comedy-drama series set against the backdrop of contemporary London. Harry Oxford, a priviledged Bloomsbury resident, is thrust into modern dating in a bid to satisfy his aunt's demand for marriage and to retain occupancy of her apartment. 

Harry is matched with Hattie Thoroughgood for a highbrow opera night, but it's disastrous, and Harry has to prove his worth by competing in the Thoroughgood's tennis tournament, which leads to an unexpected revelation of his love interests. 

A clash of old-world ideals with contemporary romance. A journey of personal awakening. Harry Oxford slowly begins to discover himself, contemplating the true meaning of love and partnership. The series brims with wit, irony, and heartfelt moments.
