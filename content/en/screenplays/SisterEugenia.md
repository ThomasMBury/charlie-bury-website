A tale of Sister Eugenia's attempts to exact revenge on the new Mother Superior after a visitation from the ghost of her beloved predecessor. Eugenia must fight for justice of the soul or else face her own death of faith. 

The setting is Hexham Convent in 14th century Northumberland. A time period rich in the necessity of redemption and faith, in which morbidity is ever present. The story is directly inspired by Shakespeareâ€™s Tragedy of Hamlet. The haunting reveals to Eugenia that her Mother in Christ was murdered in cold blood. She seeks vengeance by feigning madness in the convent and discovering by way of deception that the Abbot and Mother Superior are complicit in the act. She is silenced by their wrath and imprisoned, but later finds the fortune of her freedom during the marauding of the Scots.

The vision for the film is a story of redemption showcasing a brooding medieval landscape and the supernatural as _real_, thus being true to the period. Immaculate historical details paired with these larger-than-life characters promises to engage the audience in a powerful emotional, cinematic experience.
