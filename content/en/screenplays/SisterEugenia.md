A tale of Sister Eugenia's attempts to exact revenge on the new Mother Superior after a visitation from the ghost of her beloved predecessor. Eugenia must fight for justice of the soul or else face her own death of faith. 

The setting is 14th century Northumberland, Hexham Convent. A time period rich in the necessity of redemption and faith, in which morbidity is ever present. The story is directly inspired by Shakespeare’s Tragedy of Hamlet.  
SYNOPSIS 
Eugenia is a nun at Hexham Convent ruled by Abbot Gilbert and devoted to her faith and calling. However, she is haunted by the death of her beloved Mother Superior, Sister Elizabeth. 
When the ghost of Elizabeth visits her, revealing that she was murdered in cold blood by Sister Marie out of jealousy, Eugenia is determined to seek vengeance. Through her investigation, she discovers that Abbot Gilbert and Marie are complicit in the act. 
When she finally has enough proof against those who wronged Elizabeth, Eugenia is silenced by Marie’s wrath and imprisoned at the command of Gilbert. With a second visit from the ghost of Elizabeth, Eugenia is persuaded to fight for justice and her own innocence in the face of death and despair. 
After a miraculous escape, Eugenia discloses Abbot Gilbert’s dark secret to the Bishop of Durham’s court. He is sentenced to be executed and the monastic enclosure of Hexham dissolved. Eugenia moves to Durham where she becomes a blessed Sister in the Bishop’s own house. 
VISION 
This story of justice in the eyes of the Redeemer is a testament to the power of faith. It was a common ideal of the medieval ages in which this film is set. It will feature a brooding medieval landscape and the horrors of the supernatural as real, with many political and internal conflicts interwoven in true dramatic fashion. 
Stunning cinematography and production design will be paired with a cast of rising stars to bring these larger-than-life characters to the screen and engage the audience in a powerful emotional experience. It has the potential to be a major cinematic experience.
