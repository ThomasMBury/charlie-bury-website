Resurrection is a complex horror story, combining deeply felt themes of grief, familial secrets, and the supernatural. Set against the backdrop of a bleak, rain-drenched village in the English countryside, we follow young Eli, who, after the suspicious funeral of his sister Penny, discovers her body hidden in the attic by their mother. This discovery sets off a chain of events that exposes the family's dark secrets, including the father's horrific abuse of Penny. 

As his mother succumbs to a mysterious and deadly illness, Eli seeks the aid of a Catholic priest, believing that only the sacraments can bring peace to Penny's restless spirit. Their attempts to conduct a ritual that will lay her to rest are met with chilling resistance, culminating in a haunting battle from beyond the grave. This story delves fantastically into the supernatural but also tackles the unsettling and enduring impact of trauma, exploring how the past often refuses to stay buried.
