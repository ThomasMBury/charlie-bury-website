Writer's website for Charlie Bury


### Things to add
- url change to screenplays (done)
- blog page - about/screenplays/blog/contact (done)
- remove fiction tab (done)
- homepage : News (done)
- screenplay page - ai gen image, link to sample on Google Drive (done CB)
- how to reorder the posts? (I don't need to do this but would be curious to know how to)
- how to open links in a new tab e.g. Medium - not sure this is possible though - see https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo/issues/88 CB 31/10/2023 (this is now working, though I need to check it with a GDrive link when I upload a script)
- how to show less body text in the thumbnail for screenplays and blog posts (*this would be good, as the thumbnails could be shorter and more to the point*)
- when one clicks on a keyword, it comes up with a strange subheading about taxonomy of the term - *can we edit this or just delete it?*

- BLOG PAGE not appearing - is this a bug? 

- THANK YOU! :)
